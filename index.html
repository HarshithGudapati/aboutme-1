Hi, This is Prashanth Reddy.

I am a new graduate student of Spring batch pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. I will be graduating by 2020.

I am from Hyderabad, India moved to Maryville recently. I have 2 years experience working as software developer in Accenture. I worked mainly on SAP projects. And my hobbies are listening music, playing cricket. 

My career plan is to get placed in top reputed company as a software engineer. And at the end of my graduation I would like to learn latest new technologies which helps for my growth in future.

The interesting thing about me is, I like coding and learning new technologies. Also I enjoy watching all cricket matches.
